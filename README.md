# PathForward
A Graduation project implementing everything from planning to programming and deployment

The plan is a web platform with the purpose to give meaning to those that need it most -- people who are unemployed, through matching their skills and interests with suitable social initiatives and companies.

Another planned function is to have a specific housing service implemented to also help and match people without adequate living conditions, with housing options that are registered in a database. The idea is to connect all kinds of housing-first kinda initiatives -- that is, providing housing first so that individuals *then* can take steps to get their life sorted. https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/eradicating-homelessness-finland-housing-first-programme

A report is being written that documents the process of planning and building the web platform.

More creative ideas for platform functions:
* Messaging from admins that look for matches between profiles
* AI that can help with providing matches
* Blog platform for promotion, success stories, articles about evidence-based methods
