# PathForward
A Graduation project implementing everything from planning to programming and deployment

The plan is a web platform with the purpose to give meaning to those that need it most -- people who are unemployed, through matching their skills and interests with suitable social initiatives and companies.

### Values
* Simplicity - focus on the important actions and call to actions when designing and implementing
* Speed - slick and responsive interface as well as organization
* Security - secure with encryption, hash etc
* Effective - evidence-based and systematically followed up

Put trust into peoples own capabilities
Empowering people
Subject-subject relationships
Face-to-face

Another planned function is to have a specific housing service implemented to also help and match people without adequate living conditions, with housing options that are registered in a database. The idea is to connect all kinds of housing-first kinda initiatives -- that is, providing housing first so that individuals *then* can take steps to get their life sorted. https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/eradicating-homelessness-finland-housing-first-programme

### Tools
* Frontend: React + Axios
* Backend: Spring Boot
* Database: MySQL
* Planning: Azure DevOps
* Design: Figma

A report is being written that documents the process of planning and building the web platform.

### Further Improvement Ideas
More creative ideas for platform functions:
* Messaging e.g. from case workers -> applying users about possible matches
* Integrated calendar view, e.g. for booked video meetings with meeting links
* The ability for users and admins to plan meet-ups (mainly focused on building peer-to-peer support)
* AI that can help with providing matches
* Blog platform for promotion, success stories, articles about evidence-based methods
